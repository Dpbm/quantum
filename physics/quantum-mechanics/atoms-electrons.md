* Louis de Broglie motivated a idea of the everything in the universe can act like a particle or a wave depending what experiment is being done
* he thought that a electron can act like a wave
  * the wavelength of a electron is:
    * wavelength = maxPlanck constant / electron momentum

* Einstein proved that particles that particles that moves pretty close to the speed of light, they have a different momentum
* E² = m²c⁴ + p²c², p is the momentum, m the mass of the matter particle, c the speed of the light, E is the energy
* how the mass of the light is 0, so
  * E² = p²c²
  * Using this idea Bloglie did that formula

* after these ideas, the scientists started to think, what is a wave actually, how can a matter particle have a wave associated.
* So they started to look at wave functions, trying to describe it.
* So Schrodinger did a equation (the Schrodinger's equation), that can describes this wave function in a plot
* Then Max Born, said that if we |wave function|^2 this is equal the probability to find the particle in some parts of the plot.
* So if we have a plot of a wave function, the higher amplitudes give us a higher probability of a particle be there, not the certain, but a probability


* the ground state is the minimum state of energy that a electron can have in a atom around the electro-sphere
* if we hit a electron with a photon with enough energy, it can absorb it and then jump to the next higher energy level
* a electron can hold that energy forever, so when it will come back to a lower energy level it emits a photon
* this process don't need to be step by step, if you give enough energy a electron can jump levels, and it can also move back to others levels, it's not a rule that every time it needs to come back to the ground state.
* when a electron emits a photons this have some eV energy relative of the difference between the old and the new state of energy level
* energies between these levels can't be absorb by a electron, or you give all the energy to the electron jump into another level, or nothing
* if we pass some atoms into a light spectrum, we could see that some parts will be blank, this show us all the waves that an atom can absorb, this is called a absorption spectrum
* now, if you trap these atoms in a container and give them electric energy, the atoms will emit some photons, that represent the levels of energy of that atom can emit. So if we try to represent this, as a light spectrum we can see a light spectrum almost blank, with just some specific parts that have some colors. This is called emission spectrum
* if a electron has more than 0eV, it will be out of the atom as an ion
* electrons have negative charges, but remember, when you will see what is the new level do always --> higher energy level - lower energy level

* the electron around the nucleus has a force trying to throw it out from the atom and other force that is attracting it to the nucleus (this is the electric force)
* we can describe electric force by using the Coulomb's law
  * F = k q1 q2 / r^2 --> F is the electric force, k is a constant, q1 and q2 are the charges (from the proton a electron respectively) and r is the distance between the charges
  * k = 9 * 10^9
  * e (the charge of a proton or electron) = 1.6*10^-19 Coulombs
* this electric force can be described as a centripetal force, so we can use F = ma to describe it too
  * so F = k q1 q2 / r^2 = ma
    * acceleration in this case is v^2 / r
      * F = k q1 q2 / r^2 = m * (v^2/r)
* we can think on the angular momentum of a electron that is 
  * L = r * p --> L angular momentum, r radius (vector), linear momentum (p = mv)
    * L = r * m * v * sin(theta)
    * L = r * m * v
    * Bohr said that this angular momentum should be quantized
      * L = rmv = n * h/ 2pi --> where n is some integer number
  
  * n = 1 is the ground state of the hydrogen atom

  * rn = n^2 * r1 --> rn is a radius for some integer, n is some integer, r1 is (h^2 / k * e^2 * 4pi^2 * m)
    * because that, Bohr quantized the radius of the atoms
    * r1 = 5.3 * 10^-11 m (the radius of the lowest energy level of a hydrogen atom)

* the kinetic energy of a electron is mv^2 / 2
  * KE = mv^2 /2 = ke^2 /2r
* the potential energy is given by:
  * U = k * q1 * q2 / r (it's important to keep the - signal in this equation)
    * U = -ke^2 /r
* If we want to get the total energy --> Et = KE + U
  * Et = 1/2  * ke^2/r - ke^2/r
  * Et = -1/2 * ke^2/r
  * En = -1/2 * ke^2/rn
    * En = E1/ n^2 --> E1 is equals to (-1/2*ke^2/r1)

* 1 eV = 1.6 * 10^-19 J
* U and E = 0 and r and n = infinite, so the electron is out of the nucleus
* the necessary energy to the electron ionize a electron is the E at n=1 * -1
* the ground energy of a hydrogen atom is -13.6 eV

* the farther from the nucleus the greater the energy
* E1 = 2.17 * 10^-18 <-- ground energy in the hydrogen atom
* R = E1/h * c <-- Rydberg constant  (per meters)
* 1/lambda = R (1/i^2 - 1/j^2) <-- equation that give us, the wavelength of emitted photons from an atom, since that j is the high level energy and i the low  level  energy that the electron is in now (Balmer equation)

* the velocity of an electron in the ground state of a hydrogen atom is 2.2*10^6 m/s

* when the wavelength of a electron (lambda = maxPlanck constant/ m * v) is in the same order as the diameter of the diameter of a atom (in this case the hydrogen atom ~10^-10 m) the atom will, maybe, demonstrate wavelike behaviour

* this bohr model is just for studies, this is not a real  model, so you can use these equations to test somethings, like using the Balmer equation to the at what transitions of energy levels the atom will emit a visible light and what not. (this works only for atoms with one electron)
