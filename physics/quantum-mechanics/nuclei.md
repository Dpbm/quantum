* number of neutrons in an atom = mass - atomic_number

* a proton weighs 1.00727647 amu
* a neutron weighs 1.00866490 amu

* if we try to get the mass of the atom(the predicted mass), just getting the number of protons multiplied by its weight plus the number of neutrons multiplied by its weight, this will result in a predicted mass, but if we see the real weight of the atom, this will be a little different, this difference between the predicted and the real mass is call mass defect
* the mass that the atom lost (showed us by this difference), was lost when the nucleus was formed, it was converted in energy

* we can use the Einstein's equation to calculate this energy:
  * E = mc^2 --> E is the energy in J, m is the mass in Kg and c is the speed of light in m/s

* 1 amu is equal to 1.66054 Ã— 10^-27 kg

* the nucleus is stable because this energy that was given off
* if we give to the nucleus this energy, its will break into protons and neutrons, it's called binding energy

* nucleons --> particles that form the nucleus

* the nucleus has a lot of protons that should repeal each other, but they don't by the nuclear strong force (that is greater than the electrostatic force)

* when the ratio between N (number of neutrons) / Z (number of protons) = 1, the atom is stable (when the nucleus has a small number of protons Z < 20)

* when an atom is unstable, it decay into an more stable element, and with that it emit some radiation

* the strong nucleus force only works in small distances, so when an proton is distant from others you need more neutrons to increase the strong force

* when you increase the number of the protons you need to increase the number of protons

* when Z > 83, the electrostatic force become so strong that the atom decay

* the nucleus is just a small portion of the atom

* Decay types:
  * alpha decay
    * mass-4 and Z-2
    * the alpha radiation is known as He, because your new element will have mass-4 and Z-2 and to equilibrate the equation the other emitted particle is He(4 mass, 2 protons)
  * Beta decay
    * Z+1
    * this is know as electron emission, once it will emit an electron (mass 0, -1 charge), and to equilibrate the equation your new element will transform a neutron into a proton

      * there's a similiar type of emission, the positron emission the only change is that you will lose and proton (this will be transformed to a neutron) (in the equation position has a positive charge)
