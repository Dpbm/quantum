# quantum entanglement

Yes, there are several online resources available that explain quantum entanglement in a way that is accessible to lay people. Here are a few suggestions:

    "Einstein's Biggest Blunder" - a video from the PBS Space Time channel on YouTube that provides an introduction to quantum entanglement and its implications. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO_Q_f1WgQ8

    "Quantum Entanglement" - an article on the Khan Academy website that explains the concept of entanglement using simple examples and animations. Link: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/quantum-physics/quantum-entanglement/a/quantum-entanglement-article

    "Entanglement and the Foundations of Modern Physics" - a series of lectures by Leonard Susskind on the Stanford Continuing Studies website. The lectures provide a more in-depth exploration of entanglement and its relationship to the foundations of quantum mechanics. Link: https://continuingstudies.stanford.edu/courses/physics/entanglement-and-the-foundations-of-modern-physics/20201_PHY-13-W

These resources provide a range of perspectives on quantum entanglement, from simple introductions to more advanced explorations. I hope you find them helpful!

# roadmap
Sure, here is a roadmap to study quantum computing and quantum mechanics:

    Learn the basics of quantum mechanics: Before diving into quantum computing, it's important to have a solid understanding of the underlying principles of quantum mechanics. You can start by studying topics such as wave-particle duality, superposition, and entanglement. Some recommended resources for learning quantum mechanics are:
        Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum by Leonard Susskind and Art Friedman (book and online course)
        Quantum Mechanics for Scientists and Engineers by David A. B. Miller (book)
        Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications by Nouredine Zettili (book)

    Learn the basics of classical computing: To understand quantum computing, it's important to have a good grasp of classical computing concepts such as Boolean logic, binary arithmetic, and algorithm design. Some recommended resources for learning classical computing are:
        Computer Science: An Overview by J. Glenn Brookshear (book)
        Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H. Cormen et al. (book)
        The Elements of Computing Systems by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken (book and online course)

    Learn the basics of quantum computing: Once you have a good understanding of quantum mechanics and classical computing, you can start learning about quantum computing. Some recommended resources for learning quantum computing are:
        Quantum Computing for Everyone by Chris Bernhardt (book)
        Learn Quantum Computing with Python and IBM Quantum Experience by Mridul Seth (online course)
        Quantum Computation and Quantum Information by Michael A. Nielsen and Isaac L. Chuang (book)

    Learn quantum programming: To get hands-on experience with quantum computing, you can start learning quantum programming languages such as Qiskit, PyQuil, and Microsoft Q#.
        Qiskit textbook (online)
        Quantum Programming with Qiskit by Abraham Asfaw et al. (book)
        Quantum Computing with Microsoft Quantum Development Kit by Bettina Heim et al. (book)

    Learn about quantum algorithms: To fully appreciate the power of quantum computing, it's important to learn about the most important quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers and Grover's algorithm for searching unstructured databases. Some recommended resources for learning about quantum algorithms are:
        Quantum Algorithms via Linear Algebra by Richard J. Lipton and Kenneth W. Regan (book)
        Quantum Computing since Democritus by Scott Aaronson (book)
        Quantum Computing: An Applied Approach by Jack D. Hidary (book)

    Learn about quantum hardware: To gain a deeper understanding of the physical implementation of quantum computing, you can learn about quantum hardware such as superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and topological qubits. Some recommended resources for learning about quantum hardware are:
        Quantum Devices: Foundations and Applications by Supriyo Datta (book)
        Quantum Computing Hardware Design by Sandip Kundu (book)
        Quantum Computing and Communications: An Engineering Approach by Sandor Imre et al. (book)

Remember that quantum computing is a rapidly evolving field, so it's important to stay up-to-date with the latest research and developments. You can do this by following news and research publications, attending conferences and workshops, and participating in online communities such as the Qiskit Slack channel or the Quantum Computing Stack Exchange.
