# Chatgpt conversations

Here you'll find some of my conversations with Chatgpt, with it trying to explain and guide me through the valley of quantum world.

The conversations are in `.md` file format exported with [gptmd](https://github.com/Dpbm/gptmd) firefox extension.\
Some old tests you can find in [old-files](./old-files/)
