# Null Vector: (0,0,0)
## how can I write the null vector of (a,b,c)
```
The null vector, also known as the zero vector or the origin, is a vector of all zeros. If you have a vector in three-dimensional space represented as (a, b, c), the null vector associated with it would be (0, 0, 0).

To write the null vector of (a, b, c), you simply replace each component with zero. Therefore, the null vector is (0, 0, 0).
```

## and the inverse of (a,b,c)?
```
In linear algebra, the concept of the inverse applies to matrices rather than individual vectors. The inverse of a matrix represents a matrix that, when multiplied by the original matrix, yields the identity matrix.

However, if you are referring to finding the additive inverse of a vector (a, b, c), you can obtain it by negating each component of the vector. The additive inverse of (a, b, c) is (-a, -b, -c).

Please note that the concept of the inverse is typically used in the context of matrices, and for vectors, the notion of inverse is not commonly used.

## why ther's no vector space in form of (a,b,1)
```
A vector space is a mathematical structure that consists of a set of vectors along with operations of addition and scalar multiplication. In a vector space, the vectors should satisfy certain properties, such as closure under addition and scalar multiplication.

If we consider vectors in the form (a, b, 1), where a and b are real numbers, this set of vectors does not form a vector space. The main reason is that it fails to satisfy closure under scalar multiplication.

To demonstrate this, consider the vector (a, b, 1) and multiply it by a scalar c. The resulting vector would be (ca, cb, c). If c is any non-zero value, the third component of the resulting vector is not equal to 1. Therefore, this set of vectors does not satisfy closure under scalar multiplication, which is a fundamental property for a vector space.

Hence, the set of vectors in the form (a, b, 1) does not form a vector space.
```

## closure under scalar multiplication, what's that?
```
Closure under scalar multiplication is a property in vector spaces that states that when a vector is multiplied by a scalar (a scalar being a real number or a field element), the result is still within the vector space.

More formally, given a vector space V and a scalar c, if v is an element of V, then the scalar multiple cv is also an element of V.

In simpler terms, closure under scalar multiplication means that when you multiply a vector by a scalar, the resulting vector remains within the same vector space. The vector space should contain all possible scalar multiples of any vector in the space.

For example, consider the vector space V = {(x, y) | x, y are real numbers}. If we take a vector v = (1, 2) from V, multiplying it by any scalar c (such as 3, -2, or 0.5) will still result in a vector that belongs to V. For instance, 3v = 3(1, 2) = (3, 6) is still within the vector space V.

Closure under scalar multiplication is an essential property of vector spaces and ensures that scalar multiplication is a valid operation within the space.
```

## functions that vanish at point x=0 and x=L form a vector space?
```
Yes, the set of functions that vanish at both x = 0 and x = L forms a vector space. This vector space is commonly denoted as V.

To show that this set of functions forms a vector space, we need to verify that it satisfies the vector space axioms, which include closure under addition and scalar multiplication, as well as the presence of the zero vector, additive inverses, and associativity and distributivity properties.

Closure under addition: If f(x) and g(x) are functions that vanish at x = 0 and x = L, then the sum of these functions, f(x) + g(x), also vanishes at x = 0 and x = L.

Closure under scalar multiplication: If f(x) is a function that vanishes at x = 0 and x = L, and c is a scalar, then the scalar multiple cf(x) also vanishes at x = 0 and x = L.

Zero vector: The zero function, which is the function that is identically zero for all x, vanishes at x = 0 and x = L.

Additive inverses: For any function f(x) that vanishes at x = 0 and x = L, there exists a function -f(x) that also vanishes at x = 0 and x = L, and their sum f(x) + (-f(x)) yields the zero function.

Associativity and distributivity: The vector addition and scalar multiplication operations satisfy the usual associative and distributive properties.

Therefore, the set of functions that vanish at x = 0 and x = L satisfies all the vector space axioms and forms a vector space.
```

## does a function that f(0) = f(L) forms a vector space?
```
No, the set of functions for which f(0) = f(L) does not form a vector space.

To form a vector space, a set of functions must satisfy certain properties, including closure under addition and scalar multiplication. However, the condition f(0) = f(L) does not guarantee closure under addition or scalar multiplication, making it incompatible with the vector space axioms.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate this:

Consider two functions f(x) = x and g(x) = -x. Both functions satisfy f(0) = f(L) and g(0) = g(L) since f(0) = f(L) = 0 and g(0) = g(L) = 0. However, if we consider their sum, f(x) + g(x) = x + (-x) = 0, this function does not satisfy the condition f(0) = f(L). Therefore, the set of functions satisfying f(0) = f(L) is not closed under addition.

Similarly, if we consider the scalar multiplication of a function that satisfies f(0) = f(L), the resulting function may not satisfy this condition.

Therefore, the set of functions for which f(0) = f(L) does not meet the requirements of a vector space.
```

## can you give other example, why f(0)=f(L) doesn't form a vector space?
```
Certainly! Here's another example to illustrate why the set of functions satisfying f(0) = f(L) does not form a vector space:

Consider the set of continuous functions on the interval [0, L]. Let's examine two functions: f(x) = x and g(x) = 2x.

Both functions satisfy the condition f(0) = f(L) and g(0) = g(L) because f(0) = f(L) = 0 and g(0) = g(L) = 0.

Now, let's consider their sum: h(x) = f(x) + g(x) = x + 2x = 3x.

If we evaluate h(x) at x = L/2, we get h(L/2) = 3(L/2) = 3L/2. However, if we evaluate h(x) at x = 0, we get h(0) = 3(0) = 0.

Since h(L/2) â‰  h(0), the sum function h(x) does not satisfy the condition h(0) = h(L), even though both f(x) and g(x) individually satisfy f(0) = f(L) and g(0) = g(L).

This demonstrates that the set of functions satisfying f(0) = f(L) is not closed under addition, violating one of the requirements for a vector space.
```

## what does closed under addition mean?
```
In the context of a vector space, closure under addition means that when you add any two vectors within the vector space, the sum of those vectors is also an element of the same vector space.

More formally, if V is a vector space and u and v are vectors in V, then their sum u + v is also in V.

In simpler terms, closure under addition means that the vector space contains all possible sums of any two vectors within the space. If you take two vectors from the space and add them together, the resulting vector should still belong to the same vector space.

For example, consider a vector space V consisting of all 2-dimensional vectors in the form (x, y) where x and y are real numbers. If you take two vectors u = (1, 2) and v = (3, -1) from V, their sum u + v = (1 + 3, 2 + (-1)) = (4, 1) is still within the vector space V.

Closure under addition is one of the fundamental properties of a vector space, ensuring that addition is a valid operation within the space.
```

## how can I figure out that a vector is within a vector space?
```
To determine whether a vector belongs to a given vector space, you need to verify if it satisfies the defining properties or criteria of that vector space. The specific criteria depend on the definition of the vector space, which includes certain axioms or conditions.

Here are the general steps to figure out if a vector belongs to a vector space:

Understand the vector space definition: Familiarize yourself with the defining properties or axioms of the vector space you are considering. These properties might include closure under addition and scalar multiplication, the existence of a zero vector and additive inverses, and various algebraic and distributive properties.

Check closure under addition: If the vector space requires closure under addition, ensure that the sum of the given vector with another vector from the space also belongs to the space. Add the vectors together and verify if the result satisfies the specified conditions.

Verify closure under scalar multiplication: If the vector space requires closure under scalar multiplication, multiply the given vector by a scalar and check if the resulting vector is still within the space. Make sure the scalar multiplication satisfies the required conditions.

Check zero vector and additive inverses: If the vector space includes a zero vector and additive inverses, confirm that the given vector's sum with the additive inverse of itself equals the zero vector. Also, ensure that the zero vector itself is an element of the space.

Examine any additional properties or criteria: Depending on the specific vector space definition, you may need to consider other properties such as associativity, distributivity, or specific restrictions on the vector components.

By systematically evaluating these properties, you can determine if a given vector satisfies the requirements of the vector space. If it satisfies all the specified conditions, then it belongs to that particular vector space. Otherwise, if it violates any of the properties, it does not belong to the vector space.
```

## the functions that follow f(0) = 4 makes a vector space?
```
No, the set of functions that satisfy f(0) = 4 does not form a vector space.

To determine if a set of functions forms a vector space, it needs to satisfy certain properties, including closure under addition and scalar multiplication, the presence of a zero function, and additive inverses.

Let's consider the set of functions that satisfy f(0) = 4. We can demonstrate that this set does not form a vector space:

Closure under addition: Take two functions f(x) and g(x) that satisfy f(0) = 4 and g(0) = 4. If we add these functions together, (f+g)(0) = f(0) + g(0) = 4 + 4 = 8. Since the sum does not satisfy the condition (f+g)(0) = 4, closure under addition is violated.

Closure under scalar multiplication: Consider a function f(x) that satisfies f(0) = 4 and multiply it by a scalar c. If we evaluate the resulting function cf(x) at x = 0, (cf)(0) = c(f(0)) = c(4). Unless c = 1, the condition (cf)(0) = 4 is not satisfied. Thus, closure under scalar multiplication is also violated.

Zero function: A vector space must contain a zero function, where the function evaluates to 0 for all values of x. However, in this case, there is no function that satisfies f(0) = 4 and f(x) = 0 for all x â‰  0.

Additive inverses: For every function f(x) that satisfies f(0) = 4, there should exist a function -f(x) such that (f + (-f))(0) = 0. However, due to the absence of the zero function mentioned above, additive inverses cannot be defined consistently for all functions in this set.

Given these counterexamples, the set of functions that satisfy f(0) = 4 does not meet the requirements to be a vector space.
```

## give me a list of exercises about figure out if a set of functions forms or not a vector space
```
Certainly! Here's a list of exercises to practice determining whether a given set of functions forms a vector space or not:

Let V be the set of all continuous functions on the interval [0, 1]. Determine whether V forms a vector space under the usual addition and scalar multiplication of functions.

Consider the set P of all polynomials of degree at most 2. Verify if P forms a vector space with respect to polynomial addition and scalar multiplication.

Determine whether the set of all functions f(x) defined on the real line such that f(0) = 1 forms a vector space. Consider functions with the usual addition and scalar multiplication.

Let V be the set of all functions f(x) defined on the real line such that f'(x) = 0 for all x. Determine if V forms a vector space under the usual addition and scalar multiplication of functions.

Consider the set of functions f(x) defined on the interval [0, 1] such that f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1. Determine if this set forms a vector space under the usual addition and scalar multiplication.

Let V be the set of all differentiable functions f(x) defined on the real line. Determine whether V forms a vector space under the usual addition and scalar multiplication of functions.

Consider the set of all functions f(x) defined on the interval [0, 1] such that f(0) = f(1). Verify if this set forms a vector space under the usual addition and scalar multiplication of functions.

Determine whether the set of all functions f(x) defined on the interval [0, 1] such that f(x) is non-negative for all x forms a vector space under the usual addition and scalar multiplication.

Let V be the set of all rational functions of the form f(x) = (ax + b)/(cx + d), where a, b, c, and d are real numbers with c â‰  0. Determine if V forms a vector space under rational function addition and scalar multiplication.

Consider the set of all functions f(x) defined on the interval [0, 1] such that f(x) is continuous and f(0) = 0. Determine if this set forms a vector space under the usual addition and scalar multiplication of functions.

These exercises should provide you with a good opportunity to practice identifying whether a given set of functions forms a vector space or not based on the specified operations and conditions.
```

## me answer for the first question is not, once we can't create a function that returns a negative number since the interval is just number between 0 and 1. Is it correct?
```
Your answer is partially correct. However, the reason for the set of continuous functions on the interval [0, 1] not forming a vector space is not solely because negative numbers cannot be created on this interval.

The main reason is that the set of continuous functions on [0, 1] does not satisfy closure under scalar multiplication. In other words, if you take a continuous function on [0, 1] and multiply it by a scalar, the resulting function may not remain continuous.

For example, consider the continuous function f(x) = x defined on [0, 1]. If we multiply f(x) by -1, we obtain the function -f(x) = -x. However, -x is not a continuous function on [0, 1] because it fails to be continuous at x = 0 and x = 1.

Thus, closure under scalar multiplication is violated, leading to the conclusion that the set of continuous functions on [0, 1] does not form a vector space under the usual addition and scalar multiplication operations.

While it is true that negative values cannot be obtained on the interval [0, 1], closure under scalar multiplication is a more fundamental reason for this set of functions not forming a vector space.
```

## my answer for the second is yes, we can add and multiply the polynomials and they all spans in vector space
```
Yes, you are correct. The set of polynomials of degree at most 2 forms a vector space.

To verify this, you can check that it satisfies all the properties required for a vector space:

Closure under addition: If you take any two polynomials of degree at most 2 and add them together, the result is still a polynomial of degree at most 2. The sum of two polynomials is again a polynomial.

Closure under scalar multiplication: If you multiply a polynomial of degree at most 2 by a scalar, the result is still a polynomial of degree at most 2.

Zero polynomial: The zero polynomial, which is the polynomial where all coefficients are zero, is an element of the set.

Additive inverses: For any polynomial of degree at most 2, its additive inverse (negation) is also a polynomial of degree at most 2.

Associativity and commutativity: Addition of polynomials is associative and commutative.

Distributivity: Scalar multiplication distributes over both polynomial addition and scalar addition.

Therefore, the set of polynomials of degree at most 2 satisfies all the properties of a vector space, and thus, it forms a vector space under polynomial addition and scalar multiplication.
```

## the answer of the third question is no, since if we consider f(x) = x+1 and g(x) = x^0, if we sum f(x) + g(x) = x + 2, so if x is 0, the result is 2, not 1. Is this correct? 
```
Apologies for the mistake in the third question. You are correct in your analysis.

The set of functions defined on the real line such that f(0) = 1 does not form a vector space.

As you pointed out, if we consider the functions f(x) = x + 1 and g(x) = x^0 = 1, and we add them together, (f + g)(x) = (x + 1) + 1 = x + 2. Therefore, if we evaluate (f + g)(0), we get 2, not 1.

This violates the condition f(0) = 1 for all functions in the set. Hence, the set of functions with f(0) = 1 does not satisfy closure under addition, making it not a vector space.

Thank you for catching that error, and I apologize for any confusion caused.
```

## the forth is a little strange for me, but we can create functions that always return 0, and if we sum them the result expression is always zero too. we can also multiply f(x) by any scalar, and the result will be zero too. So for me, the answer of the forth question is: yes, we can create vector space with f(x) = 0
```
Apologies for any confusion caused by the previous response. You are correct in your analysis of the fourth question.

The set of functions defined on the real line such that f'(x) = 0 for all x does form a vector space. This set includes functions that are constant, meaning their derivative is always zero.

To demonstrate this, let's consider the properties of a vector space:

Closure under addition: If you take two functions f(x) and g(x) whose derivatives are both zero, then the sum of these functions, (f + g)(x), will also have a derivative of zero. Therefore, closure under addition is satisfied.

Closure under scalar multiplication: If you multiply a function f(x) by a scalar c, the derivative of c*f(x) will also be zero, as multiplying by a scalar does not change the fact that the derivative is zero.

Zero function: The zero function, which is the function that evaluates to zero for all values of x, is an element of this set. Its derivative is always zero.

Additive inverses: For every function f(x) in this set, there exists a function -f(x) that also has a derivative of zero, and their sum f(x) + (-f(x)) yields the zero function.

Associativity and commutativity: Addition of functions is associative and commutative.

Distributivity: Scalar multiplication distributes over both function addition and scalar addition.

Therefore, the set of functions f(x) defined on the real line such that f'(x) = 0 for all x forms a vector space under function addition and scalar multiplication. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I apologize for any confusion caused.
