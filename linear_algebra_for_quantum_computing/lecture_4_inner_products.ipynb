    "The most important vectors we will encounter will be $2$-dimensional complex vector which are of length $1$. In this section we will define the **inner product** of two vectors, and the **norm** (length) of a vector which is derived from the inner product of the vector with itself. The vectors of length $1$ are sometimes referred to as **unit vectors**. We will discuss complex unit vectors in $2$-dimensional space $\\mathbb{C}^2$ and how they relate to qubits. This will lead to a discussion of the **Bloch sphere** which will be a useful way of understanding qubits and how quantum gates act on them. \n",

The most basic case of an inner product and the one we will use the most often can be thought of as the product of a row vector and a column vector of the same dimension:\n",
