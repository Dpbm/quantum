# Quantum Studies

In this repo, you'll find all the data that I'm made/used to learn something about quantum mechanics and quantum computing. If you like these subjects too, just enjoy!

```Be free to copy, test, and use some of my notes. But be careful, keep in mind that I'm not an English native speaker and also I don't know so much about these topics. So Before Believing in something That I've wrote, please check the information by yourself ðŸ˜€```

## Motivation

Some years ago, I heard about qiskit and quantum computing. At the first moment, I tried a simple `hello world circuit`, and since then I haven't delved into this subject. However, in high school, we've learned some cool things about quantum mechanics, that reminded me about qiskit and all this new computing field.\
A year later, at the university of computer science, I decided that quantum computing is a really cool area and I want to learn more about it.\
So now, I'm here, trying to understand this `quantum world` and maybe help  someone that wants to enjoy this subject too.

For sure I want a job as a quantum software engineer, but this repo is more than a cool project to get a job, I'm here to have fun learning some blowmind techniques, algorithms, equations, etc.

## What you'll find here?

Here, you'll find:

* images: Most part of my equation tests and exercises are in image format. Also, the're will have some screenshots from e-books, blogs, etc. You can find these, at least most part of them, at [images folder](./images/). Other you can find at [math](./math/) and [physics](./physics/) folders.
* code: Also, there're a lot of code that I've done for testing some algorithms and some different quantum computing topics. In case you want to run the codes, check the [code section](#run-code).
* other repos: to archive important projects for my apprenticeship, I've fork a lot of them and linked here as git submodules. I've made this, to have a more flexible way to understand what the project does and how it does.
* [utils.md](./utils.md): in `utils.md`, I put all equations and relations that I think that are useful for some occasions.
* books and courses notes: I'm also storing some notes and main topics from some books and courses that I've read/done.
* chatgpt conversations: To get some direction in my studies, sometimes I've tried to talk with chatgpt. You can find all my conversations [here](./chatgpt/).
* links: Finally, I'm listing all the links and resources that I've used at [resources.md](./resources.md). To get some good resources, check this file.

## Run Code

The run the code make sure that You have installed:

* [python](https://www.python.org/)
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
* [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

`note: some submodules could also be dependent of other tools, so make sure to follow the step by step guides`

After installing these, start a virtual environment and install the dependencies of the directory/repo. example for [code folder](./code/):

```bash
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

All the code are stored at [code folder](./code/), separated by framework, like qiskit and q#, and goal, like fixing (folder that I store tests for fixing qiskit-terra and other projects issues).

## Contributing

If you enjoy this project, and you want to help me, I'm pleased with that.\
Here are some things that you can do to help:

* add more [resources](./resources.md)
* correct typos and/or english mistakes
* fix [code](./code/)
* organize information
* finish some [todos](https://github.com/Dpbm/quantum/issues/6)
* or other things that you think that could be better

To make that, just crate a fork from this repo, and create a pull request with your change. Please, make slight changes at each commit, to be easy to find problems!

If you aren't sure that your change is actually necessary, please, open an issue explaining what you want to change.

You can also help people at [discussions](https://github.com/Dpbm/quantum/discussions). So create or just interact with already existing discussions. Please, be nice with each other.

Thanks for you contribution ðŸ¤—
