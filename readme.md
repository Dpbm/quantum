# Quantum Studies

In this repo, I'm storing my studies about quantum computing, quantum mechanics, and all around these topics.

---

There are:

* links
* code tests
* cloned repos
* some notes
* some equation tests (in images)
* and some screenshots

All these stuff I've used to learn more about quantum.

##### *Be free to copy, test, and use some of my notes. But be careful, keep in mind that I'm not English fluent and I don't know so much about these topics. So Before Believing in something That I wrote, please check the info by yourself ðŸ˜€*
