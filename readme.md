# Quantum Studies

In this repo, I'm storing my studies about quantum computing, quantum mechanics, and all around these topics.


There are:

* links
* code tests
* cloned repos
* some notes
* some equation tests (in images)
* some screenshots
* and so on...

All these stuff I've used to learn more about quantum world.


##### *Be free to copy, test, and use some of my notes. But be careful, keep in mind that I'm not an English native speaker and also I don't know so much about these topics. So Before Believing in something That I wrote, please check the info by yourself ðŸ˜€*


## Files/Folders explanation

* [study.md](./study.md) - the topics that I've studied or I'll study
* [look.md](./look.md) - useful links
* [dummyFramework/](./dummyFramework/) - a Test Framework that I've made, in python, just for fun
* [qiskit/](./qiskit/) - All Qiskit code
* [q#/](./q#/) - All Q# code
* [mechanics/](./mechanics/) - notes about quantum mechanics
* [chatgpt/](./chatgpt/) - Some conversation that I had with chatgpt
* [ultils.md](./utils.md) - useful notes and formulas
* Images - The image files represent some equations, thoughts and screenshots
* [calculus/](./calculus/) - some tests and studies about calculus
* Other directories - Are cloned repositories

## [look.md](./look.md)
In [look.md](./look.md) you'll find some patterns

* [X] - represent resources that I've used 
* [ ] - represent resources that I'll use
* -- just useful references

Each link has the following pattern:
```
[source] title (file format - optional)
```
