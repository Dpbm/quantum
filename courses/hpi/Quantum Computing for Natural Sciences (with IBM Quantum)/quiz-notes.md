## NOTES

# What does the time-dependent Schrödinger Equation describe?
The time evolution of a quantum system

# What commutation relation do fermions follow?
They anti-commute

# QPE:
accurate, high depth, can't be run on current hardware

# VQE:
heuristic, low depth, could be used for some simulations and small molecules on current hardware

# Solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation, we obtain ...
A spectrum of eigenvalues and corresponding eigenstates correspond to different excited states.

# Within the framework of the qEOM algorithm, we obtain the excitation energies by …
… solving a linear system of equations for each excitation energy.

# Decomposition:
approximate the time evolution operator

# variational methods:
implicity approximate the evolution of the wave function

# What controls the error of product formulas to approximate the time evolution operator? 
number of time steps and The number of terms in the Hamiltonian that do not commute and the magnitudes of their commutators

# error mitigation:
is a bridge from noisy hardware to full error correction
the cost lies mainly in a measurement overhead
might enable a quantum advantage of noisy devices in the future

# error correction:
will enable larger applications and algorithms than error mitigation

# Which problems of theoretical chemistry could be promising applications for quantum computers:
excited states dynamics and light matter interactions
