# Photons

* The light is both wave and particle
  * the light as particle is a discrete amount of energy that can only be recieved as none or a certain mount of energy, that is described by this equation --> E = h * f, where E is the total of energy, h is the planck constant and f the frequency
    * h = 6.626 * 10 ^ -34 J*s

  * the momentum of the light is described as p = h/lambda, where p is the momentum, h the planck constant and lambda the wave lenght in meters

* photoeletric effect
  * a photon with energy enough, can free a electron from a metal plate, transforming it in a photoelectron
  * this free electron has a velocity (v) and a mass (m), and to find out the kinetic energy: 
    * 1/2 mv^2

  * energy of the photon = energy that freed the electron + kinetic energy of the photoelectron
  * kinetic energy of the photoelectron = energy of the photon - energy that freed the electron
  * energy that freed the electron is known as work function (it is in Joules)
 
  * the energy is E = h*f

  * the speed of the light = lambda * velocity
  * velocity = the speed of the light / lambda

  * c(the speed of the light) = 2.998*10^8 m/s

  * the work function is the minimum amount of energy to free the electron

  * mass of a electron (m) = 9.11*10^-31 Kg

  * a electron can only knock out a photoelectron

  * increasing the frequency the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons increase too
  * increasing the amplitude it increases the electric current
  
  * the amplitude is related with the brightness
  
  * the work function(Î¦) depends on the metal
  
  * there's also a threshold frequency. for lower frequencies than a minimum frequency you can't free photoelectrons. This value depends on metal (v0)

  * higher amplitudes == more photons hitting the metal
