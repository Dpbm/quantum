* The light is both wave and particle
  * the light as particle is a discrete amount of energy that can only be recieved as none or a certain mount of energy, that is described by this equation --> E = h * f, where E is the total of energy, h is the planck constant and f the frequency
    * h = 6.626 * 10 ^ -34 J*s

  * the momentum of the light is described as p = h/lambda, where p is the momentum, h the planck constant and lambda the wave lenght in meters
