* Louis de Broglie motivated a idea of the everything in the universe can act like a particle or a wave depending what experiment is being done
* he thought that a electron can act like a wave
  * the wavelength of a electron is:
    * wavelength = maxPlanck constant / electron momentum

* Einstein proved that particles that particles that moves pretty close to the speed of light, they have a different momentum
* E² = m²c⁴ + p²c², p is the momentum, m the mass of the matter particle, c the speed of the light, E is the energy
* how the mass of the light is 0, so
  * E² = p²c²
  * Using this idea Bloglie did that formula

* after these ideas, the scientists started to think, what is a wave actually, how can a matter particle have a wave associated.
* So they started to look at wave functions, trying to describe it.
* So Schrodinger did a equation (the Schrodinger's equation), that can describes this wave function in a plot
* Then Max Born, said that if we |wave function|^2 this is equal the probability to find the particle in some parts of the plot.
* So if we have a plot of a wave function, the higher amplitudes give us a higher probability of a particle be there, not the certain, but a probability


* the ground state is the minimum state of energy that a electron can have in a atom around the electro-sphere
* if we hit a electron with a photon with enough energy, it can absorb it and then jump to the next higher energy level
* a electron can hold that energy forever, so when it will come back to a lower energy level it emits a photon
* this process don't need to be step by step, if you give enough energy a electron can jump levels, and it can also move back to others levels, it's not a rule that every time it needs to come back to the ground state.
* when a electron emits a photons this have some eV energy relative of the difference between the old and the new state of energy level
* energies between these levels can't be absorb by a electron, or you give all the energy to the electron jump into another level, or nothing
* if we pass some atoms into a light spectrum, we could see that some parts will be blank, this show us all the waves that an atom can absorb, this is called a absorption spectrum
* now, if you trap these atoms in a container and give them electric energy, the atoms will emit some photons, that represent the levels of energy of that atom can emit. So if we try to represent this, as a light spectrum we can see a light spectrum almost blank, with just some specific parts that have some colors. This is called emission spectrum
* if a electron has more than 0eV, it will be out of the atom as an ion
* electrons have negative charges, but remember, when you will see what is the new level do always --> higher energy level - lower energy level
